ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .	0
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .	0
so basically tasted watered down .	0
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .	0
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .	0
just left and took it off the bill .	0
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .	0
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !	0
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .	0
but it probably sucks too !	0
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .	0
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .	0
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .	0
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .	0
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .	0
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .	0
the wine was very average and the food was even less .	0
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .	0
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .	0
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .	0
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .	0
she said `` yes , sorry . ''	0
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .	0
there was only meat and bread .	0
when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .	0
she was not happy being there .	0
moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .	0
the associates program is no longer an option .	0
the decor was seriously lacking .	0
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .	0
the sales people here are terrible .	0
salsa is not hot or good .	0
so i asked for the card to be refunded .	0
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .	0
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .	0
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .	0
the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .	0
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .	0
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .	0
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !	0
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .	0
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .	0
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .	0
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .	0
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .	0
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .	0
i was very sick the night after .	0
i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .	0
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !	0
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .	0
the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .	0
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .	0
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .	0
do not go to this practice they are horrible !	0
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .	0
the only saving grace was the black beans .	0
lost a long time customer !	0
other than that , food here is pretty gross .	0
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .	0
so far i 'm not really impressed .	0
my groupon is only for the two windows .	0
safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .	0
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .	0
we will not be using this location again .	0
this is a horrible venue .	0
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .	0
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .	0
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .	0
owner : a very rude man .	0
this place is a terrible place to live !	0
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .	0
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .	0
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .	0
what about the time i wasted ?	0
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !	0
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .	0
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .	0
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .	0
not even real brown sauce .	0
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .	0
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .	0
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .	0
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .	0
the salads are ok , nothing special .	0
overall it was a miserable evening .	0
the woman did n't even apologize .	0
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .	0
zero complaints with his work .	0
the garlic bread was bland and cold .	0
the espresso was way too hot .	0
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .	0
they wo n't tell you though .	0
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .	0
gammage itself however is not so amazing .	0
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .	0
i wo n't be ordering again .	0
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .	0
she did not apologize or anything .	0
prices are just plain retail .	0
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .	0
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .	0
who knows , it might have been .	0
the beer sauce is lackluster at best .	0
the building itself looks abandoned .	0
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .	0
i 've never had a worse experience than this !	0
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .	0
if i could give zero stars i def would .	0
only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .	0
no call , no nothing .	0
i wish i could give less than one star .	0
the wonton was seriously lacking filling .	0
if i could give less stars , i would .	0
she could not and would not explain herself .	0
think twice -- this place is a dump .	0
i 'm not one of the corn people .	0
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .	0
even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .	0
as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .	0
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .	0
so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .	0
at this location the service was terrible .	0
so who do i call to get my money back .	0
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .	0
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .	0
service was a little slow to begin with .	0
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .	0
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .	0
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .	0
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .	0
i expected so much better from this ny staple .	0
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .	0
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .	0
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .	0
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .	0
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .	0
i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .	0
and the cleaning is way over priced .	0
they make a bad name for used car dealers .	0
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .	0
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .	0
so sad but i am not going back any more .	0
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .	0
the new management team is horrible !	0
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .	0
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .	0
the evening started out slow .	0
i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .	0
the queen bed was horrible !	0
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .	0
oh , i should not have asked .	0
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .	0
this place is just ok .	0
i have to say i was truly disappointed .	0
this is the reason i will never go back .	0
furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .	0
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !	0
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .	0
nope , way way worse .	0
there are no smiles and no customer service .	0
when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .	0
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .	0
if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .	0
plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .	0
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .	0
it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?	0
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .	0
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .	0
was n't busy , no biggie .	0
the bathroom area is nothing special .	0
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !	0
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .	0
so i brought my business elsewhere .	0
exhibit c : no more student services peeps .	0
so disappointing from an old favorite .	0
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .	0
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .	0
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .	0
i will never visit the salon again .	0
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .	0
i would n't go back there again .	0
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .	0
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .	0
as for the food , never had it .	0
however , the tech said nothing to me about this .	0
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .	0
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .	0
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .	0
it does not take that long to cook sliders !	0
the sandwich was not that great .	0
the man did not stop her .	0
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .	0
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .	0
it is also quite expensive for my taste .	0
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .	0
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .	0
it shows that this restaurant has no class .	0
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .	0
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .	0
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .	0
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .	0
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .	0
even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .	0
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .	0
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .	0
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .	0
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .	0
just terrible is all i can say .	0
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?	0
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .	0
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .	0
we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .	0
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .	0
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .	0
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .	0
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .	0
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .	0
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .	0
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .	0
is zero stars an option ?	0
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .	0
but let this story begin at noon today .	0
seriously though , i have never shopped here .	0
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .	0
but their inventory was questionable !	0
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .	0
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .	0
were we irritating her or something ?	0
this place has pissed me off for the last time .	0
do not sign a lease with these people .	0
do n't waste the trip .	0
had to returned one entree because too cold .	0
the restroom was a mess .	0
i mean that 's been my experience !	0
the beef taco was good but nothing special .	0
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .	0
i went to sit down and wait for my order .	0
its also not a very clean park .	0
i tried to call repeatedly with no response .	0
they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .	0
it looks old and outdated .	0
he did not return my call either .	0
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .	0
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .	0
the food here is bland and boring and bad .	0
this one is not on the ball .	0
for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !	0
the tow package is not an issue either .	0
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .	0
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .	0
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .	0
you can not pay me to ever shop here !	0
french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .	0
now the food : not horrible , but below average .	0
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .	0
no stars is what in want to give .	0
when it came we should have sent it back .	0
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .	0
i 'm not willing to take the chance .	0
this place smelt like old urine for some reason .	0
bottom line they over promise and under deliver .	0
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .	0
nothing that special about this place .	0
razz 's failed on every occasion .	0
management no longer cares about the golf experience .	0
20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .	0
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .	0
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .	0
not sure and i do n't care !	0
two hours of my life i can never get back .	0
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .	0
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .	0
service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .	0
second time , not so good .	0
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .	0
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .	0
what the hell are you doing ?	0
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .	0
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .	0
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .	0
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .	0
i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .	0
liar , liar , pants on fire .	0
parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .	0
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .	0
not so great food and service .	0
this is an old worn out hotel .	0
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .	0
the mechanics are very amateur as usual .	0
this place is beyond a shit hole .	0
this place is a shit hole with shit service .	0
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .	0
went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .	0
service was just as disappointing .	0
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .	0
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .	0
management does not seem to care .	0
i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .	0
it is not really brown rice .	0
did n't even get a response .	0
needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .	0
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .	0
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .	0
had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .	0
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .	0
i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .	0
i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .	0
it did n't get finished .	0
we will not be coming back .	0
he could n't actually read her pressure , though .	0
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .	0
ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .	0
even the water tasted horrible .	0
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .	0
sounds good does n't it ?	0
but it was disgusting and hot in there .	0
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .	0
it was over fried and very hard .	0
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .	0
the overall prices are not competitive with frys .	0
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .	0
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .	0
and management does n't do anything about it .	0
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .	0
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?	0
i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !	0
these days the quality is pretty lousy .	0
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .	0
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .	0
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .	0
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .	0
maybe they were having a bad night ?	0
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !	0
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .	0
so , it went in the trash .	0
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .	0
so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .	0
hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .	0
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .	0
when it finally came out , it was bad .	0
talk about false advertising so call before you go !	0
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .	0
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .	0
but the customer service ruins it all for me .	0
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .	0
i was very disappointed with this place .	0
so you are n't my problem . ''	0
unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .	0
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .	0
she does n't say anything and just walks away .	0
the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .	0
the staff was nowhere to be found .	0
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .	0
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .	0
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .	0
save your money & your patience .	0
what a waste of my time and theirs .	0
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .	0
my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .	0
the server was n't buying .	0
worst customer service i have ever had .	0
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .	0
and for this reason , i wo n't return .	0
this branch is getting worse and worse .	0
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .	0
they can thank you for the low rating .	0
i did n't even eat it .	0
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .	0
there was no personality to our server .	0
if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .	0
i did n't know ra was a chain .	0
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .	0
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .	0
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .	0
the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .	0
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .	0
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .	0
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?	0
maria the manager is a horrible person .	0
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .	0
we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .	0
first , the bartender was an a -- hole .	0
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .	0
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .	0
oh well , who cares ... right ?	0
we will spend our money elsewhere .	0
i will never purchase another lv bag again .	0
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .	0
we did n't leave with anything that day .	0
horrible , horrible , horrible service !	0
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .	0
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .	0
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .	0
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .	0
you can not judge people based on appearance .	0
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .	0
the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .	0
no courtesy and their food is pathetic .	0
i would never reccomend anyone to live here .	0
had to wait a month to get in .	0
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !	0
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .	0
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .	0
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .	0
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .	0
tonight i lost all respect for this company .	0
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .	0
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .	0
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !	0
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .	0
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .	0
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .	0
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !	0
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .	0
the food is not that authentic .	0
actually , just keep walking .	0
unfortunately , it is the worst .	0
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .	0
not so much these days .	0
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .	0
this is the worst panda express location there is !	0
the door would n't open at all .	0
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .	0
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .	0
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .	0
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .	0
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !	0
this is a terrible college .	0
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .	0
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .	0
the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .	0
i looked around and there were still customers .	0
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .	0
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .	0
in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .	0
avoid if at all possible .	0
i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .	0
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .	0
it 's just too expensive for what you get .	0
also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?	0
went into this location to drop it off .	0
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .	0
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .	0
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .	0
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .	0
the beer was nice and cold !	0
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .	0
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !	0
there are much better places for breakfast .	0
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .	0
it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .	0
um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .	0
pathetic place , worst food .	0
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .	0
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .	0
anything they say , ask in writing .	0
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .	0
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .	0
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .	0
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .	0
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !	0
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .	0
incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .	0
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .	0
the problem is nothing was good .	0
i tried to no avail .	0
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .	0
horrible job on nails and toes .	0
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .	0
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .	0
simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .	0
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .	0
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !	0
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .	0
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .	0
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .	0
desert followed but nothing special .	0
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .	0
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .	0
however , this experience went pretty smooth .	0
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .	0
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !	0
she was getting pissed , and so were we .	0
did n't seem to care about their job .	0
would have rated lower if i could .	0
not personalized or warm at all .	0
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .	0
i do not like the size of the dance floor .	0
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .	0
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .	0
their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .	0
no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .	0
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .	0
ra sushi , you are so blah to me .	0
half of my head was over processed .	0
an old dude did my pedicure .	0
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .	0
`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .	0
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .	0
they do not stock some of the most common parts .	0
it 's small yet they make you feel right at home .	1
i will be going back and enjoying this great place !	1
